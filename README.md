## 📝 Project

The goal was to recreate an order summary component with a responsive design that matches the original layout. I used this project to practice good component organization and learn Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ReactJS  
- TypeScript  
- Vite  
- Tailwind CSS 4.1  

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using Tailwind's new syntax (`@theme`) for color and font tokens  
- Organizing layout with small, well-defined components  
- Responsiveness logic using `window.innerWidth`  
- Applying visual effects with transitions, hover, and active states  
- Using custom fonts and style variables
